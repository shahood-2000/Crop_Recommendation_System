# Crop Recommendation System ðŸŒ¾

A Machine Learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and climate conditions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall .

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset )

##  Features Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Model training and evaluation
- Real-time crop recommendation function

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Ensemble Voting Classifier (soft voting)

## Acuracy 
--> The ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99% on the test set.
